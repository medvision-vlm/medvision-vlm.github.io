## Highlights

* **Research Gap**: modern VLMs are not reliably able to produce precise quantitative measurements from medical images.
* **Dataset**: MedVision, a large-scale, multi-modality dataset for quantitative medical image analysis, covering 22 public datasets and 30.8M images with structured measurement annotations.
* **Benchmark**: the first comprehensive evaluation of contemporary VLMs on detection, tumor/lesion size estimation, and angle/distance measurement.
* **Supervised Finetuning (SFT)**: SFT can improve the performance of VLMs on quantitative medical image analysis tasks.
* **Code and Models**: data, model checkpoints, and code (training and evaluation) are available
